## Github Public Repository Exercise

Have you ever wanted to get a tree structure of a github public repo?

- Great! now you can :)

## But how?

In order to run the app, you should go the root folder and:

1. install the dependencies in the root folder using -> npm install
2. npm run server

Now you can open http://localhost:3001 in your browser and get the tree structure you desire
